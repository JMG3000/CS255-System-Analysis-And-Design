## CS-255: System Analysis and Design

### This repository contains a project created to demonstrate the skills and techniques I developed in CS‑255: System Analysis and Design.

The DriverPass project centers on designing a comprehensive system for a client seeking to improve how students prepare for their driver’s license exams. The client required a web‑based platform that allows students to register for driving packages, schedule on‑the‑road lessons, take practice tests based on DMV materials, and track their overall progress. The system also needed robust administrative tools for managing users, scheduling instructors and vehicles, maintaining up‑to‑date DMV content, and generating detailed reports.

The primary objective was to design a secure, scalable, and user‑friendly solution. One that supports multiple user roles; including students, instructors, administrators, and IT staf. It must also enable real‑time scheduling and reliable data validation at the same time.

### What I Did Particularly Well

I believe I performed particularly well in translating business requirements into structured system components and UML artifacts. My sequence and activity diagrams clearly demonstrated interactions between system components, such as authentication, scheduling validation, and database communication. I also improved significantly in separating high-level business goals from functional requirements after instructor feedback. This strengthened the clarity and professionalism of the documentation.

### One Area I Would Revise

If I could revise one part of my work, I would further refine the objectives and goals section in the Business Requirements Document. Earlier drafts blended measurable goals with functional statements. I would improve this by ensuring objectives remain outcome-focused and strategic, while functional requirements clearly use structured phrasing such as “The system shall…”. I would also expand role-based system component descriptions to ensure each actor’s purpose is unmistakably defined.

### Interpreting and Implementing User Needs

I interpreted the user’s needs by analyzing the client interview and identifying core pain points: inconsistent scheduling, lack of centralized content, limited progress tracking, and inefficient manual processes. I translated these needs into functional requirements such as secure login authentication, role-based access control, scheduling validation logic, payment processing integration, and automated progress tracking dashboards.

Considering user needs is critical in system design because software exists to solve real problems. Ignoring user requirements can result in poor usability, security flaws, inefficiencies, or system rejection. Designing with the user in mind ensures adoption, efficiency, and long-term success.

### My Approach to Designing Software

When designing software, I begin with requirement analysis and stakeholder identification. I then decompose the system into processes, identifying inputs and outputs for each function. I use UML diagrams (use case, activity, and sequence diagrams) to model behavior and validate logic before implementation.

In the future, I will continue using structured requirement tracing, iterative refinement, and feedback incorporation as primary strategies. I will also place stronger emphasis on validating assumptions early, separating strategic goals from technical specifications, and ensuring security and validation logic are explicitly modeled in diagrams.

This project strengthened my ability to analyze business problems, translate client needs into structured documentation, and model system behavior using industry-standard techniques. It also reinforced the importance of clarity, precision, and user-centered design in software development.
